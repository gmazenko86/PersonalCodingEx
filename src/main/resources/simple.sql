--exists operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery
--think of it as a boolean

--any and all operators are used with a WHERE or HAVING clause
--note that 'some' is a synonym for 'any'
--The '=' ANY is equivalent to IN operator.
--note that the below queries do not work in Intellij for some reason
--but they work from the command line or when executing from a java program
select product_name

--another example
select customer_id, City, Country
from customers

--null functions allow you to replace a null value. coalesce() works here
--may be IFNULL(), ISNULL(), COALESCE(), or NVL() depending on the database
--note since the alias "multiplied units" has a space, it is enclosed in quotes
select product_name , unit_price *

--stored procedures. postgresql syntax quite different from others

--postgresql documentation says to use call instead of exec
call printinfo;
--above 2 (create then call) worked from the command line, but did not return anything
--says "Unlike a user-defined function, a stored procedure does not have a return value"
--pgAdmin4 does show that the printinfo() procedure exists as defined above

--many ways to create a function. the one below works, along with the query below
--note that corresponding scripts can be created and run in pgAdmin4
create or replace function addints(integer, integer) returns integer
    as 'select $1 + $2;'

--in java, the 'addints' function can be executed with
--statement.executeQuery("select public.addints(5, 6);");
--the same as any other query string. It returns a java ResultSet
--from the command line, this will return 1 record with an 11 in a column entitled addints;
